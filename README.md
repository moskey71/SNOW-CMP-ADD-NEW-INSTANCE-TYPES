Description:  This repo is meant to contain scripts that add AWS EC2 instance types to the SNow CMDB, so they can be used with the Cloud Management Plugin (CMP).  Once the instances are in the CMDB, they can be mapped to Compute Profiles, and called from within a BluePrint.

Usage: In your SNow instance, navigate to 'scripts - background' and paste the contents of the script into the freeform text field and click submit.  The script will update ALL logical datacenters with the instance types.
